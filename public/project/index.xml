      <description>&lt;p&gt;What are Mainer&amp;rsquo;s attitudes towards parole for violent and non-violent crimes? How is parole for prisoners portrayed through media and facebook coverage? What can we learn from other states and country&amp;rsquo;s justice systems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is in collaboration with NeCSA and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manomet.org&#34;&gt;Manomet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding tobacco-use among recent immigrants and refugees in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is in partnership with &lt;a href=&#34;https://akhss.org&#34;&gt;Ak Health and Social Services&lt;/a&gt;, a Lewiston-based nonprofit that connects recent immigrants and refugees with social services such as COVID-19 testing, vaccinations, counseling services, emotional support, need assessments and workforce development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lyme Disease in Maine</title>
      <link>/project/lyme-project/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/lyme-project/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In partnership with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mmcri.org/?page_id=1090&#34;&gt;Maine Medical Center Research Institute&amp;rsquo;s Lyme and Vector-Borne Disease Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease is a debilitating bacterial infection that affects more than X people each year. Spread through ticks, Mass vaccination can greatly reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases such as rabies, however, there is relatively little scientific guidance as to how long control programmes must operate and how they should be best implemented to achieve elimination. My PhD and Postdoc focused on two pivotal questions in infectious disease ecology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the underlying determinants of disease persistence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can vaccination strategies be optimised to eliminate infection?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, I analysed a rich and highly resolved spatial dataset of fox rabies cases and oral rabies vaccination (ORV) programmes throughout Western Europe. The long-term, large-scale nature of these data provides a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of wildlife rabies dynamics in response to vaccination using novel spatial modeling techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
