      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Laurie Baker and my pronouns are she/her. I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in Digital and Computation Studies at Bates College. My research focuses on spatial and temporal patterns in human and biological systems, including disease spread, animal movement, and economic activities such as fishing and shipping. I use spatiotemporal modelling and other data science techniques to understand these patterns and to evaluate the impact of interventions and policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work also focuses on the development of open-source materials that lower barriers to data science education and equip communities with the tools to engage in data science work so that they can address issues of local importance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Students will work in multi-disciplinary teams on a research problem identified by a community partner from business, industry, or government. Together with community partners, students will work to gain insight from data, building skills in reproducible analysis (literate programming and version control) and collaboration, using modern programming tools and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course emphasizes putting knowledge into practice, including going beyond individual fields of study to solve real world problems and understand community partner needs. Students will build skills in project management, using agile methodologies and weekly meetings with community partners designed to foster co-development and iterative and incremental project delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students will develop their mathematical and programming skills as well as skills and traits valued by employers of STEM professionals, such as teamwork, reproducible analysis, effective communication, independent thinking, and problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;
