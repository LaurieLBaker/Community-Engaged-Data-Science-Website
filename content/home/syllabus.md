## Course Description

Hello and welcome to *Community-engaged Data Science**. This course will introduce students to data analysis and visualization with R. This course is intended for students with a strong interest in applied problem-solving. Students will work in multi-disciplinary teams on a research problem identified by a community partner from business, industry, or government. Together with community partners, students will work to gain insight from data, building skills in reproducible analysis (literate programming and version control) and collaboration, using modern programming tools and techniques. 
This course emphasizes putting knowledge into practice, including going beyond individual fields of study to solve real world problems and understand community partner needs. Students will build skills in project management, using agile methodologies and weekly meetings with community partners designed to foster co-development and iterative and incremental project delivery.
Students will develop their mathematical and programming skills as well as skills and traits valued by employers of STEM professionals, such as teamwork, reproducible analysis, effective communication, independent thinking, and problem solving. 

The course content is organized in three units:
 
- **Unit 1 - What is the plan?:** This unit is an introduction to the projects and toolkit of the course. Students will define and identify key project milestones, and explore approaches to solving the problem. 
- **Unit 2 - Exploring data:** This unit focuses on exploring the problem through data wrangling and data visualization. In this unit, we focus on tidy data, data import, data cleaning, and data curation.
- **Unit 3 - Project Delivery and Next Steps:** After completing the exploratory phase, students wrap up the project in a report and present next steps. 

## DCS Values, Goals, and Practices

The primary purpose of Digital and Computational Studies is to bridge the liberal arts education to computing and the digital world.  In this, we are committed to actively creating digital and computational spaces that are radically inclusive. Our core commitment is to integrating equity and social justice throughout our curriculum, and engaging students in metacognition to support this work. Digital and Computational Studies Courses fall into a continuum of experiences that range from critical digital studies to programming, with an integrated core that embraces both. See the [DCS website](https://www.bates.edu/digital-computational-studies/values-goals-and-practices/) for details on DCS values, goals, and practices.

## Learning Objectives 
This course is designed as a community learning journey. Together, we will:

- Identify and plan our own personal development plans.
- Play with computational ideas creatively, using a growth mindset which values revision and experimentation. 
- Gain experience in data collection, wrangling, visualization, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling and effective communication of results in partnership with community partners.
- Engage and reflect on contemporary issues in environmental and social justice related to your digital world, community and positionality. Critically evaluate the origins of data and the limitations of analysis techniques.
- Demonstrate community leadership skills as a collaborator that shares strengths, builds weaknesses, and contributes to a broader shared understanding. 
- Build skills valued by employers including teamwork, reproducible analysis, effective communication, independent thinking, and problem solving. 

It is also my hope that in this course you:

- Develop an appreciation for reproducibility, transparency, accessibility and inclusivity in data collection, analysis, and communication.
- Build knowledge and skills in data science skills to tackle questions that are important to you. 

## Course Materials required: 

### Books:

All books for this course are freely available online as e-books. We will be using two main texts:

### Grading scale:

Lower bound percent earned for letter grade:
A  93     A-  90    B+  87    B  83     B-  80    C+  77    C  73    C-  70   D+  67   D  63   D-  60   F below 60 
A+    reserved for exceptional work

### Sharing / reusing code

I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something the course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class. You are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not send or make use of code from another team.

### Academic integrity

Bates College takes academic misconduct very seriously and is committed to ensuring that so far as possible it is detected and dealt with appropriately. 

Cheating or plagiarizing on assignments are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate the University policies, and will not be tolerated. Make sure to review the [Student Guide to Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures](https://www.bates.edu/student-affairs/files/2015/02/Student-Info-Sheet-Academic-Integrity-2016-17.pdf) on the Bates website. Such incidences will result in a 0 grade for all parties involved. 

## Universal Learning and Learning in Community

Many of us learn in different ways.  For example, you may process information by speaking and listening, so while lectures are quite helpful for you, some of the written material may be difficult to absorb. You might have difficulty following lectures, but are able to quickly assimilate written information.  You may need to fidget to focus in class.  You might take notes best when you can draw a concept.  For some of you, speaking in class can be a stressful or daunting experience.  For some of you, certain topics or themes might be so traumatic as to be disruptive to learning. The principle of Universal Design for Learning calls for our classrooms, our virtual spaces, our practices and our interactions to be designed to include as many different modes of learning as possible, and is a principle I take seriously in this class. 

It is also my goal to create an inclusive classroom, which depends on community building, and which requires everyone to come to class with mutual respect, civility, and a willingness to listen to and observe others. As such the syllabus serves as a contract of some expectations between all members of the class, including myself.
 
If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please reach out to me and your student support advisor.  If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you may also want to meet with [Abigail Nelson](https://www.bates.edu/student-affairs/student-affairs-staff/abigail-nelson-2/), Assistant Dean of Accessible Education and Student Support, to begin this conversation or request an official accommodation. You can find more information about the Office of Accessible Education and Student Support, including contact information, on the accessible education page of the [Bates website](http://www.bates.edu/accessible-education/).  If you have already been approved for accommodations through the Office of Accessible Education please let me know! We can meet 1-1 to explore concerns and potential options.  If you do not have a documented disability, remember that  student support services are available to all students through the Math and Stats Workshop (R, Math, and Stats).

### Late work, extensions, and special circumstances

All work is due on the stated due date. Due dates are there to help guide your pace through the course and they also allow me (the course professor) to return marks and feedback to you in a timely manner. However, sometimes life gets in the way and you might not be able to turn in your work on time. Note, first of all, that the lowest score of labs and homework assignments is dropped. So if you miss one assignment, this can be your dropped score. Resubmission is built into each assignment. You will first receive feedback on each assignment before receiving a final grade. All resubmissions are due 7 days after feedback is received. It is your responsibility to keep track of this deadline. For instance, if a homework is due on 

If you intend to submit work late for an assignment or project, you must **notify me** before the original deadline and as soon as the completed work is submitted on GitHub. Lab work cannot be submitted late, Note also that each of you have 3 late days you can put towards homework assignments during the semester without receiving a late penalty. 


### Learning during a pandemic
 
I want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don't hesitate to ask.

- You *never* owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you're always welcome to talk to me. If I can't help, I likely know someone who can.
 
- I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.
