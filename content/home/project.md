## TL;DR

The final project for this class will consist of analysis on a dataset of your own choosing. The dataset may already exist, or you may collect your own data using a survey or by conducting an experiment. You can choose the data based on your interests or based on work in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.


### Deliverables

Together with your team, you will produce a weekly presentation to stakeholders. This is an opportunity to show your progress, ask questions, and get feedback.

You will also work on and submit a final report to the stakeholders.

#### Team Contract

One of the main goals of this course is that you build and develop community leadership skills as a collaborator that shares strengths, builds weaknesses, and contributes to a broader shared understanding. These skills will serve you in this course and beyond in your careers. A crucial part of building strong collaborations is good communication.

Each team will draft a group contract. A group contract is a document to help you formalize the expectations you have for your group members and what they can expect of you. It will help you think about what you need from each other to work effectively as a team! You will create and agree on this contract as a team and refer to it during the project.

At a minimum, your group contract must address these questions:

##### Goals:

- What are our team goals for this project?
- What do we want to accomplish?
- What skills do we want to develop or refine?

##### Expectations:

- What do we expect of one another regarding attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, quality of work, etc.?

##### Policies & Procedures:

- What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations?

##### Consequences:

- How will we address non-performance regarding these goals, expectations, policies and procedures?

Each member should "sign" (you can just type out your name) at the bottom of the submission.

#### Report

The write-up, which you can also think of as an summary of your project, should provide information on the dataset you're using, your research question(s), your methodology, and your findings. 

#### Repo organization

The following folders and files in your project repository:

* `presentation.Rmd` + `presentation.html`: Your presentation slides
* `README.md`: Your write-up
* `/data/*`: Your dataset in csv or RDS format, in the `/data` folder.
* `/report`: Your report write up

Style and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your data and code are properly formatted including labelling code chunks. Pay attention to images and plots included in the presentation and make sure to include appropriate alternative text.

## Tips

- You're working in the same repo as your teammates now, so merge conflicts will happen, issues will arise, and that's fine! Pull, commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck.
- Review the marking guidelines below and ask questions if any of the expectations are unclear.
- Make sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team members).
- Set aside time to work together.
- When you're done, review the documents on GitHub to make sure you're happy with the final state of your work. Then go get some rest!

- Teamwork: You are to complete the assignment as a team. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and team evaluations will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment works.
