Understanding tobacco-use among recent immigrants and refugees in Maine.

This project is in partnership with [Ak Health and Social Services](https://akhss.org), a Lewiston-based nonprofit that connects recent immigrants and refugees with social services such as COVID-19 testing, vaccinations, counseling services, emotional support, need assessments and workforce development.
