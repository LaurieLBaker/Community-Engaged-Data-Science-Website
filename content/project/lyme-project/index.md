title: Lyme Disease in Maine

---

Maine has high rates of tickborne diseases including Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. Tickborne disease are spread to humans through the bite of an infected deer tick (*Ixodes scapularis*) and can have serious health implications (see table below). Lyme disease cases have increased significantly from a single case in 1986 to 1,844 in 2017, reflecting the northward range

expansion of I. scapularis ticks (1). (Cite Susan's paper and the Rand paper)

Diagnosis of Lyme disease is typically through primary care providers. While 70-80% of people nationally infected with Lyme disease show a skin rash referred to as the "Bull's-eye" rash or erythema migrans (EM). Further medical education training is required to improve primary care provider's diagnoses of the 20-30% of Lyme disease cases where the patient does not present the Bull's eye rash.

Studying Lyme disease incidence is a challenging problem. High Lyme disease incidence may reflect areas with a higher risk of Lyme disease or primary care providers who are good at accurately detecting Lyme disease symptoms. Similarly, low Lyme disease incidence may reflect areas with a lower risk of Lyme disease or primary care providers who may be missing Lyme disease cases. Passive tick submission data (where ticks are mailed in or dropped off at testing facilities) give some insight into the prevalence of Lyme disease in ticks across Maine, however, this data can be biased by who submits ticks and the Lyme disease awareness and concern of individuals. 

Students will work in partnership with researchers from the [Maine Medical Center Research Institute's Lyme and Vector-Borne Disease Lab](https://mmcri.org/?page_id=1090) to create an intitial workflow and methodology and interactive dashboard to map primary care providers and identify areas with a high-risk of Lyme disease where medical education training programs to improve Lyme disease diagnosis should be rolled out. Some questions students might consider in this work is whether to look both at areas with very low (possible undiagnosed cases) and areas with high incidence of Lyme disease, how to take into account the population and/or catchment area a provider serves, and how inequity in access to healthcare, including distance to a primary care provider or lack of insurance may affect Lyme disease diagnosis.

|:---|:--|:--|:--|
| **Anaplasmosis** | Caused by the *Anaplasma phagocytophila* bacteria | Symptoms include fever, headache, malaise, and body aches. | Anaplasmosis can be a serious illness and can be fatal if not treated correctly. |
| **Babesiosis** | Caused by the *Babesia microti* parasite | Symptoms include extreme fatigue, aches, fever, chills, sweating, dark urine, and possibly anemia. | Babesiosis can be life threatening. |
| **Lyme disease** | Caused by the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacteria | The first clinical sign of the disease is a skin rash referred to as the "Bull’s-eye" rash or erythema migrans (EM). This occurs in 70-80% of people nationally, usually within 3-30 days after a tick bite. Other signs include arthritis, Bell’s Palsy, and heart problems. |  |
